## Libraries and Frameworks

<List of major libraries and frameworks used in the project, with a brief description of their purpose.>

## Quick Reference

`just` tool with a `justfile` in root of the repository contains useful commands for activating and managing python environment and managing common tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Run tests | `just test`|
| Lint code | `just lint`|
| Format code | `just format` |
| Fix lint issues | `just fix` |
| Add dependency | `uv add <package>` |
| Run demo | `just demo` |
| Clean files | `just clean` |

## Demo

Run `just demo` to populate fixture data and launch a Streamlit app showcasing all functionality.
Every project should maintain a working demo that visually demonstrates what it can do.

## Coding Standards

- **Style**: Use ruff for linting and formatting
- **Python env**: Project uses uv for python env management
- **Testing**:
    * All new code requires tests in `tests/` that focus on what user expects the behaviour to be, not on what the code already does.
    * Every test is annotated with human readable description of what property of expected behaviour a given test case is capturing
    * Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Types**: Include type hints in function signatures
- **Docs**:
    - Keep docstrings concise but informative
    - Keep documentation concise but informative and avoid excess comments that just describe what code is doing.
    - Check for python typing information in method signatures is correct and if documentation needs to be updated to reflect existing functionality.
    - When writing new documentation from scratch, be very concise about what you add. Things can always be added later, but verbose documentation is difficult to verify.
    - Avoid superlative adjectives in code comments and documentation. Use clear, concise language that describes the functionality without exaggeration. e.g. instead of saying "Provides comprehensive support for...", simply state "Supports...".
- **Make code easy to change**:
    - When possible make code easy to change in the future.
    - Isolate distinct concerns into distinct components because that makes code easy to change.
    - Create components with single responsibilities because that makes them easy to change.
    - Name things well because that makes code easy to read and make changes to.
    - Allow for design decisions to be reversed because that makes code easy to change when new requirements arrive.
    - Adhere to DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle if possible.
    - Centralize definition of the same knowledge and use it in all places it's used.
    - When possible attempt to refactor code to obey this principle.
    - Design systems to have orthogonal functionality.
- **Simplicity**:
    - When implementing new code solution try to limit amount of new code generated (especially one not dedicated to solving the core issue). Things can always be added later, but verbose code is difficult to verify.
    - Prefer simple solutions over complex abstractions
    - Prefer composition over inheritance
    - Keep functions small and focused
- **Align**:
    - Before implementing new functionality think if the capability is already handled by an existing solution part of the system.
      e.g. if your solution needs configuration or secrets management, is there already a library that helps with that?


## Workflow Requirements

### Before Committing

1. Run `just lint` - fix any errors
2. Run `just format` - format code
3. Run `just test` - ensure tests pass
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated for changes
- [ ] Linting passes (`just lint`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Demo updated if new features added
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Agent Configuration

This project uses `CLAUDE.md` as the primary instruction file for both GitHub Copilot and Claude Code. Tool-specific configuration:

| Path | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Copilot | File-scoped rules (Python src, tests, docs) |
| `.github/agents/*.agent.md` | Copilot | Agent definitions (contribution-expert, plan) |
| `.claude/rules/*.md` | Claude Code | File-scoped rules (same content as Copilot) |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` | Claude Code | Slash commands (`/test`, `/lint`, `/format`, `/verify`, `/clean`) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code | Hooks: auto-format and lint `.py` files after edits |
| `.claude/hooks/` | Claude Code | Hook scripts executed by settings.json |

## Template Origin

This project was created from the `acme-project-create` template. If you develop reusable patterns or improvements, consider contributing them back to the template.
