# Python Source Conventions

- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Follow ruff rules: E, F, I, W, UP
- Line length: 100 characters max
- Use `src/<package>/` layout
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Name things precisely — optimize for readability
- Keep docstrings concise but informative
- Avoid excess comments that restate obvious code
- Avoid superlative adjectives in comments and docstrings
