# Documentation Conventions

- Keep documentation concise but informative
- Use tables and bullet points for scannability
- Focus on what users need to do, not internal implementation
- Avoid superlative adjectives — use clear, direct language
- Update docs when API or behavior changes
- Use MkDocs Material theme conventions
