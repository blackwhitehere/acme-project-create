# Documentation Conventions

- Keep documentation concise but informative
- Use tables and bullet points for scannability
- Focus on a user's perspective in the User section of the docs: understand main concepts and abstractions provided by software and how to use them. 
- Focus on developer's perspective in the Developer section of the docs: understand internal implementation details and how to extend or modify the software.
- Avoid superlative adjectives — use clear, direct language
- Update docs when API or behavior changes
- Use MkDocs Material theme conventions
