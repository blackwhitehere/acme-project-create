When possible make code easy to change in the future.
Isolate distinct concerns into distinct components because that makes code easy to change.
Create components with single reponsibilities because that makes them easy to change.
Name things well becasue that makes code easy to read and make changes to.
Allow for design decisions to be reversed because that makes code easy to change when new requirements arrive.

Adhere to DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle if possible. Centralize definition of the same knowledge and use it in all places it's used. When possible attempt to refactor code to obey this principle.

Design systems to have orthogonal functionality.

Check for python typing information in method signatures is correct and if documentation needs to be updated to reflect existing funcionality.
Keep documentation concise but informative and avoid excess comments that just describe what code is doing.
